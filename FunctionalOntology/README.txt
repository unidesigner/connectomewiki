    relates to Functional concept:
    (represents role by designer, interpretation by understanding system,
    means-end relationship)

Spatiotemporal patterns in brain networks
    relate to functional concept
        in turn relate to behavioral concept

First, we need to describe the functions of the system. In this context, this means distinguishing
all functions and subfunctions we can by carefully observing other human being's behaviour, in normal
and pathological condition, and by distinguished introspection.

In terms of the mathematical conceptualisation, what we are after is to understand what are lower level
and the higher level features extracted from raw measurements/data. This could be framed in linear algebra
terms when thinking about the basis functions (vectors) that span the space of possible states of the system.

In the end, we want to be able to tell the story from raw sensory data "up" to our conscious experience of the
world and elaborate all the intermediate steps that that are necessary to construct the internal world-model
we are all inhabiting/living in.

A lot of work has been done in terms of understanding very basic primary sensory levels of encoding/representing
information (i.e. certain variables such as frequency, amplitude, phase) and what kind of features are extracted
based thereof. An often cited example is the visual system's receptive fields (REF).

We can observe the emergence of qualitatively different features on which the same process of feature extraction
is applied.... this approach can be termed bottom-up.

Going the other way round, top-down and starting from experience directly and trying to find words for things
that are far to obvious to think of them, but exactly focusing on them and making them explicit in an ontology of
experience.

Hopefully, we can bridge this two approaches and relate them to neuranatomy and neurophysiology to gain a
clearer picture.....my goal is to help minimize the suffering of our fellow beings with the help of the knowledge,
eduction and tools I have.
